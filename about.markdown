# About Me

Growing up in the diverse landscapes of Arizona, I developed a deep appreciation for the natural world around me. While many associate Arizona with desert terrain, it was the state's hidden treasures—its mountain forests and alpine environments—that truly captured my heart.

## My Journey into Forestry

This love for forests led me to pursue my passion academically. In 2023, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Forestry from Northern Arizona University (NAU), where I immersed myself in understanding forest ecosystems, conservation practices, and sustainable resource management.

## Discovering GIS

Continuing my studies in Flagstaff, I began working toward my Master's degree, where I discovered something that would reshape my career trajectory: **Geographical Information Systems (GIS)**. What started as a tool for my forestry work quickly became a passion in its own right. The power to visualize, analyze, and understand spatial data opened up entirely new ways of seeing and protecting our natural resources.

Maps became more than just navigation tools—they became windows into complex environmental relationships, patterns of change over time, and powerful instruments for conservation planning.

## Looking Forward

I'm set to complete my Master's degree in **December 2025**, and I'm excited to continue building my career at the intersection of natural resource management and GIS technology. My goal is to use these combined skills to contribute to meaningful conservation efforts and help protect the forests and natural spaces that have inspired my journey.

## Beyond the Classroom

When I'm not analyzing spatial data or studying forest ecosystems, you'll likely find me exploring Arizona's diverse landscapes—from the Sonoran Desert to the ponderosa pine forests of the Colorado Plateau. Each environment teaches me something new about the intricate relationships that sustain our natural world.
